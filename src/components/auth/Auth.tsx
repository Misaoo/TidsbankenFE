    On mount the Auth Component makes a request to /authorize to check whether the current user is 
    logged in or not (logged in meaning if their session is valid).

    If the response is 200 OK the user session is valid and we add the user info (as returned in the response data)
    to the AuthContext.

    We also add a timestamp to localstorage to allow for easy checking during the session if the session is valid.
    A future improvement might be to retrieve the timestamp for when the session expires from the backend request. 
    And do some checking if that timestamp is in the future or past to allow for quicker authentication without having
    to make requests to authorize.
